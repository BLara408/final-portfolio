The site is bugged at first launch click the portfolio button and back home to see these features the deployment route im having trouble with.


This is my personal Portfolio website that is hosted on my github pages. This is the homepage it comes with interactable buttons that all have css animation, there is a backround video playing. The styling for the container holding the video are borrowed styling from tutorials but all components other then those are made by me.

The about me section is made and styled by me with custom fonts I imported from google fonts. All of these parts are custom react components I made.

This form component I found the styling for and implemented it, the form works fully and when you press the submit button the form will send straight to my email while resetting all of the input boxed! Perfect way to get into contact with me. The social icons are imported from react-social-icons npm package and they link to my github and linkedin
NEXT SECTION PORTFOLIO

This is a seperate page that you can get to by either clicking the button on the homepage or the button at the top titled portfolio.
These are custom card-item and card components styled with bootstrap and normal css. The cards have a img header and text field and social icons link directly to the repositories of each project.
